1. Purpose & Responsibilities
This backend service is responsible for:

Exposing HTTP endpoints for all domain operations (CRUD and beyond).

Implementing business logic and validation rules in a centralized, testable layer.

Persisting and retrieving data from MongoDB.

Authenticating and authorizing each request to enforce security policies.

2. Architectural Patterns
Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):
We separate writes (commands) from reads (queries) to keep each side focused on its job. Learn more: [CQRS pattern overview.
](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)




MediatR for in-process messaging:
Controllers send commands/queries to MediatR instead of calling services directly. MediatR then invokes the matching handler. Details:[ MediatR Pattern.](https://medium.com/@dnzcnyksl/mediator-pattern-in-c-109b691ff45b)
.


How the Repository Layer is Structured
IAtlasMongoRepository (Generic)
This interface has only one job:
→ Provide a method to get the MongoDB collection for a given model (like Order, User, etc.).

It does not implement operations like Insert, Update, Delete.

It keeps the MongoDB collection handling centralized and reusable.

Feature-Specific Repositories (like IOrderMongoRepository)
Each model (like Order) has its own repository and interface.

Example:

IOrderMongoRepository defines methods like InsertAsync, FindByIdAsync, etc. — but only for orders.

OrderMongoRepository implements these methods.

Inside OrderMongoRepository, when we need to talk to MongoDB:

It first gets the right collection using IAtlasMongoRepository.

Then it performs the required action (insert, update, delete, find) on that collection.

Simple Example Flow (for Orders)
OrderMongoRepository calls GetCollection<Order>() from IAtlasMongoRepository.

It gets the "Orders" collection from MongoDB.

Then it runs InsertOneAsync(order) directly on the collection




Configuration Management
We use appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json to separate environment-specific settings (like DB connections, URLs, etc.).

Environment Variables are used for sensitive data like passwords and secrets.

Example:
MongoDbSettings__Password
(the double underscore __ maps to nested JSON keys).

This makes our application more secure, more flexible, and easier to deploy across different environments.

5. Program.cs and Dependency Injection
The Program.cs file serves as the entry point of the application. It is responsible for:​

Configuring services: Registering services like controllers, database contexts, and custom services using dependency injection.

Setting up the middleware pipeline: Defining how HTTP requests are handled by configuring middleware components.

Loading configurations: Reading settings from various sources such as appsettings.json, environment variables, and command-line arguments.​

For a comprehensive guide on configuring Program.cs, refer to the official documentation: ASP.NET Core



6. MongoDB Setup & Dependency Injection
To keep our MongoDB integration clean, efficient, and secure, we follow these steps—no code snippets, just the concepts you’ll capture in your README:

Connection Details in Configuration

We store the connection string and database name in appsettings.json (and appsettings.Development.json for local testing).

Any sensitive pieces (like the password) come from environment variables named with double-underscores (e.g. MongoDbSettings__Password), which override the JSON values at runtime.

Binding Settings at Startup

When the application starts, ASP .NET Core automatically reads the JSON files and environment variables, and binds them to a simple “settings” object.

This gives us a single, strongly-typed place to grab our MongoDB connection details, without ever using new or hard-coding strings.

Registering Core Services as Singletons
We register three MongoDB-related services in the DI container—each as a singleton so there’s exactly one shared instance for the life of the app:

MongoClient
Acts as the gateway to your MongoDB server. It manages a pool of network connections under the hood, so you never pay the cost of reconnecting on every request.

MongoDatabase
Points at the specific database (e.g. Production). All your collections come from here. Since it’s cheap to retrieve from the client, we still keep it as a singleton for consistency.

Generic “Key-Ring” Service
Our IAtlasMongoRepository wraps the database and lets any part of the app say, “Give me the Orders collection,” or “Give me the Users collection,” without knowing the connection details.

Why Singletons?

Performance: One connection pool for everything, no repeated handshakes.

Thread-Safety: The MongoDB driver’s client and database objects are designed to be safely shared across threads.

Simplicity: Every controller, handler, or repository just asks the DI container for these services—no manual wiring or magic needed.

With this setup, any repository or handler can simply declare, “I need the generic Mongo service” or “I need the database,” and the DI container hands it a fully-configured, ready-to-use MongoDB connection—securely configured, environment-aware, and highly efficient.
